            He got up and shouted "Bravo!" in appreciation and encouragement.
            Sona turned to look at him, wondering who he might be who could
            understand the intricacies of each and every stance and step during
            the fight.

            By now Udayavarma had learnt all her strategies, and the next day he
            was ready to fight with her. The two fought cleverly and fiercely.
            Neither of them was prepared to surrender to the other. During her
            fight Sona tried all her tricks, but Udayavarma was able to meet
            every one of them. She soon discovered that he was a good swordsman
            and that she would not be able to subdue him so easily. Soon Sona
            was defeated by Udayavarma.She stopped the fight and joined her
            parents.

            Cheers rose from the audience who was watching the proceedings very
            eagerly. When Udayavarma came forward to present himself to the King
            and queen, Sona recognized him as the one who had cheered her in
            encouragement the other day.She asked Udayavarma and he confessed to
            it.
