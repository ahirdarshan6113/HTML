            Once upon a time there was born a beautiful daughter, Mandaravati,
            to a very famours priest. When the daughter grew of age, the father
            was worried about her marriage.Once, three eligible bachelors came
            to the father and each asked him for the hand of the daughter. Each
            of them threatened to kill himself lest the daughter be married off
            to any other of the three. The father decided not to marry her off
            to anyone.
          </p>
          <p>
            One day, she caught a very high pitched fever and died suddenly. All
            three of them, grief-struck, cremated the body of Mandaravati. One
            of them decided to stay there and slept on the ashes of Mandaravati.
            The other took her bones and went to the Ganges. The third became an
            ascetic and wandered off.
          </p>
          <p>
            On one of his wanderings, the third one reached a brahmin's house. The 
brahmin, by power of a spell, was able to bring the dead alive from the ashes. 
This was in a book which the brahmin gaurded safely. But the third suitor, in 
the stealth of night, stole this book and went back to the cremation ground of 
Mandaravati. The second one had returned from the Ganges with the holy 
water, and the first one was still there sleeping on the ashes.
