            The Betaal then narrated this story. The ruler of Kishanagar,
            Rajendra, was extremely strong and courageous. He was a good ruler
            and cared about his people very much as he would not do anything
            unjust. His subjects were happy and contented. They had no problems.
            His queen, Prema, gave birth to a beautiful daughter, Sona.
          </p>
          <p>
            Being an only child, Sona enjoyed a lot of freedom and was brought
            up like a boy. She grew up clever not only in studies but in the use
            of the bow and arrow and sword. She learnt the art of self-defence.
            When she reached marriageable age, her parents began searching for a
            suitable husband for her.
          </p>
          <p>
            She said to her parents that ,"Dear Father, I want that my husband
            should be one who is highly skilled in fighting and who is able to
            overpower, me in fight. Suppose if our kingdom face an enemy in the
            future, he should be able to fight & defeat them in war. If you
            agree to this condition then, you may make an announcement".
