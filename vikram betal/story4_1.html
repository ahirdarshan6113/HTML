            Then he with the help of the other two, recited the spell from the
            book and lo Behold!! Mandaravati was reborn! Then the three of them

            Betaal stops and asks King Vikram asks this question: Who among the
            three suitors should be the husband of Mandaravati? Vikram replies
            with a lot of thought, "The person who gave her the life by reciting
            the spell is her creator, it could be her father. The person who
            took her bones to Ganges shall be her son. But the person who
            committed himself to the ground and slept on her ashes out of love,
            can be her husband."
          </p>
          <p>
            As soon as Vikram had finished his answer, Betaal disappeared back
            to the tree
