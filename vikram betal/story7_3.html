                    His stepmother was not at all kind- hearted, and she ill- treated him much. It 
was seldom that he even got a full meal. She knew that the boy, with his 
handicap, would not be much use to her.

                    Kurupshana did not utter a word in protest or by way of complaint. But he 
lamented within himself. ‘Mother is always scolding & harassing me under 
one pretext or other. Won’t there be an end to all this? They feel that I’m no 
good and I had better die! I must take this as a challenge and show them that I 
too, can face life.’

                    He decided to go to Kanchannagar. Quite a few princes had by then assembled 
at Kanchannagar. There were some young men, too, wishing to try their luck, 
if the princes were to fail. They all spent their time guessing what kind of tests 
the princess would put them through. Some of them thought it could be 
wrestling. Some others thought it could be their performance with the bow 
and arrow.

                    The time came to announce the details of the tests. The King & Princess 
Indumati came to the stage and sat next to the king, and on the other side of 
the king sat the Prime Minister. He got up from his seat and faced the princely 
suitors. " The contest is about to start! Several suitors are present here to win 
the hand of princess Indumati. It is her wish that they are put to certain tests. 
Whoever succeed in the test will qualify to wed her. You all can see the wall 
in front of you. You have to climb the wall and jump down into the threetiered cage of sharp knives. The test is, while doing so, you must be careful 
not to injure yourself. There should not be a single scratch on your body from 
the blades of the knives. Whoever is willing to participate in the test may step 
forward!"
