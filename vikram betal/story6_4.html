                    Now Sona knew how he had succeeded in overpowering her. She came 
forward and said to him that "My condition was that I would marry anyone 
who would defeat me in the contest. Though you’ve defeated me, I can’t 
marry you. You can yourself find out the reason." Udayavarma thought for a 
while and said . "Yes what you say is right, O Princess. I should not marry 
you." He bowed to her and left the palace.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The king and queen were surprised over their daughter’s decision as according 
to her contest Sona insisted that she would marry only that man who would 
defeat her in the fight and Udayavarma had achieved it , but now she was not 
ready to marry him and even Udayavarma, too, had meekly accepted her 
decision, saying he could not possibly claim her hand. How strange! They 
were unable to guess what really was the cause?

                <p>
                    The relationship between a teacher and his student is more sacred than that 
between others. That’s why Sona went back on the condition she herself had 
stipulated. Betaal knew that king will definitely speak out the answer so he 
flew back to the ancient tree carrying the corpse along with him.
