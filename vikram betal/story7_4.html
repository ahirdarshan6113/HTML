                    Many princes rose from their seats, and went and took a good look at the high 
wall as well as the cage of knives. One by they went back to their seats. The 
wall looked too high for them; the cage was placed deep down below; and the 
space between the knives was very small. They would not be able to jump 
down without injuring themselves. None dared even to make an attempt.

                    As they went back to their seats, some of them protested. "What kind of test is 
this? It could have been a sword- fight or wrestling or 
archery, or any other of that kind. But not this! It is 
almost trap from where one can’t escape with one’s 
life. Why should any one sacrifice his life for the
hand of a mad princess in the world!"
                </p>
                <p>
                    It looked as though no suitor was willing to take the 
test. The king was in a dilemma. He regretted that his 
daughter did not accept his advice and desite from 
insisting ontests.

                    Kurupshana was watching all this from his seat. suddenly a thought struck 
him. After all, people back home, like his stepmother, were only wishing for 
his death. If he were to succeed in the test by the grace of god, he stood to win 
the hand of none else than a princess!
