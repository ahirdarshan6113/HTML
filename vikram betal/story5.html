            Once upon a time there lived a washerman named Dhavala. He once
            spotted a very beautiful lady at pond, who happened to be the
            daughter of another washerman. He instantly fell in love with her
            and pleaded with his parents to ask her parents for her hand in
            marriage. His parents did accordingly and the girl, Madanasundari,
            got married to him with her parents consent. She then went with
            Dhavala to live with him.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once the brother of Madanasundari, came to Dhavala to invite his
            sister and brother-in-law to their place for festival season.
            Dhavala agreed and the three of them were returning to
            Madanasundari's home. On the way they happened to pass by the temple
            of Durga Devi, the all powerful goddess of power. Her brother wanted
            to pay a visit to the goddess, and went to the temple. But as soon
            as he came near the goddess, he wanted to make a massive sacrifice
            to the goddess.
          </p>
          <p>
            So saying he cut his head off for the goddess. Madanasundari was
            worried and she then sent her husband to see what the matter was. On
            seeing the state of his brother-in-law, the husband was also moved
            deeply and he decided to offer his own head too to the goddess and
            cut his own head with his scitmar. Madanasundari, after a long wait
            came and saw both her brother and husband lying on the ground and
            then decided to take her own life but asked the goddesss to get the
            same brother and husband in the next life.
