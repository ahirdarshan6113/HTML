            It was a dark night and was raining heavily and there were strange
            noises from every where and voice of the moaning of jackals could be
            heard.

            Although there was a bad atmosphere king Vikramaditya did not fear a
            bit. He climbed the tree to bring the corpse down and soon he began
            to walk with the corpse lying on his shoulder.
          </p>

            The Betaal spoke: "O King , I pity you as you are making untiring
            efforts without relaxing as if you wish to achieve something.
            Instead of enjoying a comfortable sleep in your palace you’re still
            coming after me”
          </p>
          <p>
            King didn’t speak anything because any word from his mouth would
            keep Betaal right back on the tree.
          </p>

            Once Upon a time there lived a king named Chandrakant. He is very
            brave and kind king. He was taking good care of his subjects.
            Everyone was living with peace in his kingdom.
