                    after having succeeded in the test and qualified to 
wed the princess, why did not want to marry her? What was the reward he was 
referring to when he said he didn’t want to aspire for anything 
more? If you know the answer and still decide not to satisfy me, 
beware, your head will be blown to pieces!

                    "True, Kurupshana was a handicapped young man," said the 
king. " He was fully aware of his handicap that bothered his 
stepmother. He really wished that she changed her opinion 
about him. She should not any longer feel that he was no good. 
Instead she should know that where people with no handicap had failed, he 
could, despite his handicap, come out a victor.

                    That, for him, was the biggest reward he could aspire for. He decided to 
undergo the hazardous test not with the hope of marrying a princess. If he 
married her, he would one day be called upon to rule the kingdom. But as a 
ruler, he wouldn’t be able even to hold sword.

                    Betaal knew that king will definitely speak out the answer 
so he flew back to the ancient tree carrying the corpse along 
with him.
