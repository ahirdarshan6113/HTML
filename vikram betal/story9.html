                    It was a dark night and was raining heavily and there were strange noises from 
every where and voice of the moaning of jackals could be heard.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although there was a bad atmosphere king Vikramaditya did not fear a bit. 
He climbed the tree to bring the corpse down and soon he began to walk with 
the corpse lying on his shoulder.

                    The Betaal spoke: "O King , I pity you as you are making untiring efforts 
without relaxing as if you wish to achieve something. Instead of enjoying a 
comfortable sleep in your palace you’re still coming after me”
                </p>
                <p>
                    King didn’t speak anything because any word from his mouth would keep 
Betaal right back on the tree.
                </p>

                    Long long ago, Kanchannagar was being ruled by King Chandradeep . His 
daughter was Indumati . Being an only child, the princess was brought up like 
a boy, and given training in the use of arms an warfare. The princes of many 
of the neighbouring kingdoms cherished a desire to marry Indumati, who was, 
extremely beautiful.
