                    Whenever the king broached the subject of marriage, Indumati said "Yes, 
but... Whoever marries me must be strong and brave. And he must succeed in 
the tests that I give."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Indumati, then she listed out what kind of tests she was contemplating for her 
suitors. The king was horrified. "Don’t insist on any such test, They’re all 
hazardous. No one will come forward to undergo the tests for fear their life. 
Just forget about them."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Indumati said, "Don't worry father! All those who said that they love me than 
their life will certainly take these tests.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    The royal announcement about the princess wedding was made stated that the 
suitors would have to take certain tests. The announcement was made in all 
the neighbouring kingdoms.
