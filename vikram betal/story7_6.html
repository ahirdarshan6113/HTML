            He then took a good look at the cage and jumped down. He landed
            between the knives arrayed all around on all the three tiers. He was
            unscrathed! A loud cheer arose from the audience.

            The cage was slowly raised, to allow the young man to come out. He
            then walked towards the king and the princess. Their face had gone a

            Kurupshana realised their predicament. "O King! Please don’t worry.
            I didn’t wish to marry the princess. I had only wanted to take a
            challenge and I know I’ve succeeded.

          <p>
            That itself is a big reward of my life and I can now face life." He
            bowed low before the king and retreated.

            The vampire ended his narration there and turned to King
            Vikramaditya. " O King! Didn’t Kurupshana behave like a foolish? If
            he had no intention of marrying the princess, why did he at all
            decide to undergo the test?
