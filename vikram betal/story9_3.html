                    Many princes took a good look at the high wall as well as the cage of knives. 
The wall looked too high for them; the cage was placed deep down below; and 
the space between the knives was very small. None dared even to make an 
attempt. As they went back to their seats.

                    It looked as though no suitor was willing to take the test. The king regretted 
that his daughter did not accept his advice. Kurupshana was watching all this 
from his seat. Suddenly a thought struck him. After all, people back home, 
were only wishing for his death. If he were to succeed in the test , he stood to 
win the hand of princess So, he decided to try his luck. He left his seat and 
walked up to King Chandradeep. The king was shocked. Princess Indumati, 
too, was in a similar dilemma. She was expecting to be married off to a prince. 
Suddenly a doubt arose in her mind: would this young man be able to 
complete the test. King Chandradeep waited for a moment to know his 
daughter’s decision, and then gave the permission to Kurupshana. Kurupshana 
went up the wall. He then took a good look at the cage and jumped down. He 
landed between the knives arrayed all around on all the three tiers. He was 
unscathed! He then walked towards the king and the princess. Kurupshana 
said "Huzoor ! Please don’t worry. I didn’t wish to marry the princess. I had 
only wanted to take a challenge and I know I’ve succeeded. That itself is a big 
reward of my life and I can now face life." He bowed low before the king and 
retreated.
