                    "Donâ€™t worry, father," Indumati, assured Chandradeep . " All those who 
profess that they love me than their life will certainly take these tests. You just 
watch!"
                </p>
                <p>
                    The king consulted his ministers.They came out with a suggestion. "If the 
princess is determined to impose the tests, let her wish be carried out," said 
the prime Minister. "But when we make the announcement, let us not spell out 
the details. They will be let known only at time of the test."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Chandradeep agreed to the suggestion. The royal 
announcement about the princess wedding merely stated 
that the suitors would have to take certain tests.. The 
announcement was made in all the neighbouring 
kingdoms, including Jayanagar, where a young man 
named Kurupshana heard it.

                    He had been born with both hands stunted. His mother 
died soon after he was born, and his father took a 
second wife. The boy was named Kurupshana, the ugly
looking.
