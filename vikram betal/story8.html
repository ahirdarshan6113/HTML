                    Once upon a time there lived four sons of a poor brahmin who taught them all 
the Vedas and the holy scriptures. On their parents death, they decided to go 
and stay with their mother's father. But on reaching there they found that they 
were unwelcome there and that their cousins were unreceptive to the brothers. 
Then the brothers decided to each go out into the world and learn a special 
skill and come back and meet at a common place after a while. So they 
dispersed and came back to the same place at the appointed time. Each told 
what he had learnt. The first one said, " I can create flesh of a creature from a 
single one of the creature". The second one said, " I know how to grow the 
hair and skin of a creature if it has flesh and bones." The third one said, "I can 
create the limbs of a creature if its form is complete with skin hair and flesh 
and bones". The fourth one said, " I know how to give life to that creature 
once it is complete in form with limbs".
                </p>
                <p>
                    So they set off into the forest to find a piece of bone on which they could test 
their skills. The first one they found was a lion's. So each of them displayed 
his skill and created a live huge Lion, which as fate would have it, killed all 
four of them and sped away.

                    Betaal stops and asks King Vikram asks this question: Who among the four 
brothers is responsible for the death of all of them? Vikram replies with a 
lot of thought, "The fourth one, as he was the one who gave life to the 
otherwise dead structure of bones flesh and limbs and hair"
