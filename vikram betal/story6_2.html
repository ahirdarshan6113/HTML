            The King & Queen were very proud to hear about their daughter's
            thoughts.The announcement was made in Kishanagar as well as in the
            neighbouring kingdoms. Thinking that Sona is only a girl,and it
            should not be a difficult to win a fight with her, many suitors came
            forward to accept her challenge as they also knew that Sona being
            the only heir they would have complete sway over the kingdom once
            they married her.
          </p>
          <p>
            But when they (the suitors) met Sona face to face these princes
            realized it was not that easy to defeat her. Everyone of them was
            routed by Sona, and they had to go back disappointed. She was taking
            on the suitors one after another, among them was Udayavarma, the
            prince of Chandanghar.

            He watched the fight every day , by joining the crowd. He carefully
            watched how Princess Sona fought and the different strategies she
            adopted to meet the method of fighting followed by each prince. One
            day, he could not control himself when he saw a particular way she
            used the sword.
