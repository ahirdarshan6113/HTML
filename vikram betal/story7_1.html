                    Long long ago, Kanchannagar was being ruled by 
King Chandradeep . His daughter was Indumati . 
Being an only child, the princess was brought up 
like a boy, and given training in the use of arms an 
warfare. It was certain that whoever wed her would 
also become the ruler of Kanchannagar. The princes 
of many of the neighbouring kingdoms cherished a 
desire to marry Indumati, who was, besides 
everything else, extremely beautiful.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Whenever the king broached the subject of 
marriage, Princess Indumati, would hesitate to 
give him a definite answer, but one day Indumati said yes to his father, "Yes, 
father, but...". The king stared at her , waiting for her to complete the 
sentence.
                </p>
                <p>
                    " Whoever marries me must be strong and brave. And he must succeed in the 
tests that I give." Indumati, then spelt out what kind of tests she was 
contemplating for her suitors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The king was horrified. "Don’t insist on any such test," he advised the 
princess. " They’re all hazardous. No one will come forward to undergo the 
tests for fear their life. Just forget about them."
