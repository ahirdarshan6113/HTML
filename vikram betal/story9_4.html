                    The Betaal ended his story and asked to Vikramaditya “King! Didn’t 
Kurupshana behave like a 
foolish? If he had no intention of marrying the princess, why did he at all 
decide to undergo the test?” And after having succeeded in the test and 
qualified to wed the princess, why did 
not want to marry her? “ , “If you know the answer and still decide not to 
satisfy me, beware, your head will be blown to pieces!”
                </p>
                <p>
                    ""You are right, Kurupshana was a handicapped young man," said the 
Vikramaditya." He was aware of his handicap that bothered his stepmother. 
He really wished that she changed her opinion about him. She should not any 
longer feel that he was no good. Instead she should know that where people 
with no handicap had failed, he could, despite his handicap, come out a victor. 
That, for him, was the biggest reward he could aspire for. He decided to 
undergo the test not with the hope of marrying a princess. If he married her, 
he would one day be called upon to rule the kingdom. But as a ruler, he 
wouldn’t be able even to hold sword and could not even protect his kingdom, 
so it wouldn’t be wise decision for him to marry her. That’s why he gave up 
his claim to her hand. It was the decision of a wise person."

                    Betaal knew that king will definitely speak out the answer so he flew back to 
the ancient tree carrying the corpse along with him. Vikramaditya drew his 
sword and went after the Betaal .
